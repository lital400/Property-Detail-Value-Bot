# Property-Detail-Value-Bot

As part of a directed independent study at UNF, I had to research some real estate properties (1,007 entries, to be exact). 
Instead of doing it manually, I built this bot that would open a broswer, go to a local Property Appraiser website, 
search each real estate number (using the file resulted from my previous bot - see the Property-Bot repository), 
and retrieve the required property information (property details & property value). The data is then saved as a csv file.
